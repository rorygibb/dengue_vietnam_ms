# The interaction of urban infrastructure, mobility and climatic change in driving dengue emergence in Vietnam

Disentangling the drivers of spatiotemporal patterns and trends of dengue in Vietnam, 1998-2021. This repository contains the full modelling pipeline scripts to implement the analyses in the accompanying manuscript. To demonstrate the modelling pipeline, we provide a subset of the dengue incidence time series data for 4 geographically diverse provinces of Vietnam: Ha Noi (Red River Delta), Dak Lak (Central Highlands), Khanh Hoa (South Central Coast) and Dong Nai (Southeast). Example scripts to implement sections of the pipeline for this subset are provided in the "scripts_example" folder.
